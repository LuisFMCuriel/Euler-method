# Euler-method
The Euler method is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations.
The program asks you to introduce some information, as the values of the initial conditions of the differential equation (y0,x0), the step size and how many steps do you want to take. 
Also for default it has the function dx/dy = 2x + 2y, if you want to change this, I recommend you to change the form of the function.
